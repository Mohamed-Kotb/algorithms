Given an array of numbers, we can construct a new array by replacing each element by the difference between itself and the previous element,
except for the first element, which we simply ignore. 
This is called the difference array, because it contains the first differences of the original array.
We will denote the difference array of array A by D(A). 
For example, 
the difference array of A = [9, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5, 0, 7] is D(A) = [2-9, 6-2, 3-6, 1-3, 5-1, 0-5, 7-0], or [-7, 4, -3, -2, 4, -5, 7].

We see that the difference array can be computed in linear time from the original array, and is shorter than the original array by one element
